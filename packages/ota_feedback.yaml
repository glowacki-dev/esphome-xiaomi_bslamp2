# These OTA triggers are used to provide some visual feedback during the OTA
# flashing process. The light is turned blue when the upgrade starts, the
# brightness indicator will represent the update progress (fills up from 0%
# to 100%), the light will flash red when the upgrade fails or green when the
# upgrade succeeds.
